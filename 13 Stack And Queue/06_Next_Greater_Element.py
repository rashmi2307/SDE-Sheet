# Given an array arr of size n containing elements, find the next greater element for each element in the array in the order of their appearance.

# The next greater element of an element in the array is the nearest element on the right that is greater than the current element.

# If there does not exist a next greater element for the current element, then the next greater element for that element is -1.

# Example 1
# Input: arr = [1, 3, 2, 4]
# Output: [3, 4, 4, -1]
# Explanation: In the array, the next larger element to 1 is 3, 3 is 4, 2 is 4 and for 4 is -1, since it does not exist.

# Example 2
# Input: arr = [6, 8, 0, 1, 3]
# Output: [8, -1, 1, 3, -1]
# Explanation: In the array, the next larger element to 6 is 8, for 8 there is no larger elements hence it is -1, for 0 it is 1 , for 1 it is 3 and then for 3 there is no larger element on the right and hence -1.
