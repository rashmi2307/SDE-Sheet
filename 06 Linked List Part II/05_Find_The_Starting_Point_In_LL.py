# Given the head of a singly linked list, the task is to find the starting point of a loop in the linked list if it exists. Return the starting node if a loop exists; otherwise, return null.

# A loop exists in a linked list if some node in the list can be reached again by continuously following the next pointer. Internally, pos denotes the index (0-based) of the node from where the loop starts.

# Note that pos is not passed as a parameter.

# Example 1
# Input: head -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5, pos = 1
# Output(value of the returned node is displayed): 2
# Explanation: The tail of the linked list connects to the node at 1st index.

# Example 2
# Input: head -> 1 -> 3 -> 7 -> 4, pos = -1
# Output(value of the returned node is displayed): null
# Explanation: No loop is present in the linked list.
